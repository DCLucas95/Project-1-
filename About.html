            <br>
            <p>Our program takes your favourite things and uses the tastedive API to give
                recommendations on
                other things
                you will like based on what you searched for.</p>

            <p>See something that peaked your interest? Give it a click and you'll see a wikipedia summary of that item.
                If
                its music or a movie, maybe its the genre. If it's a book, maybe the plot. Either way, this should give
                you
                a
                much better understanding of your suggestions and why they were shown to you. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Why did we make this?</h2>
            <p>We made this for the people who are always looking for new things to learn and the ones who cant make a
                decsion on what to do next. We hope that our app will help you to find the next thing that youll then be
                recommending to your friends because you loved it so much.</p>
